### Hello World üåç, my name is Sonia On√≠s Arg√ºelles
#### ‚öíÔ∏è Work In Progress :butterfly: 

Do you think that people can change careers throughout their lives? Well, I do, and I'm working on it... I am reinventing myself professionally by moving towards web development. 

The exciting world of technology attracts me because of its infinite creative possibilities and how it can become a powerful tool, used in an ethical and humanistic way, that contributes to the development of the world. 

My background as a journalist, writer and organiser of literary events or international institutional meetings, to name a few of my "professions", has helped me to have a passion for learning, versatility, curiosity and to think out of the box, skills that are valued in the field of technology. Over time we better understand the connection of the dots.

For now, I'm in the caterpillar stage of the butterfly metamorphosis :butterfly:: training, learning, practising. 

Skills: HTML / CSS/ JS / VUE JS / BOOTSTRAP/ SASS/ FIGMA/ TRELLO/ NOTION/ SCRUM
