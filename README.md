### Hello World üåç, my name is Sonia On√≠s Arg√ºelles
#### ‚öíÔ∏è UX Writer - UX/UI Design - Web Accesibility 

My professional career in communication and marketing has been driven by curiosity, the constant search for knowledge and creativity, always with a primary focus on people. These values led me to enter the exciting world of technology, where innovation and continuous learning are essential.

During my recent participation in the F5 Factory Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I have consolidated my skills in a 100% practical environment. Through the development of projects similar to those requested by end-clients and applying Agile and Scrum methodologies, I have acquired a solid perspective in web development.

In my professional evolution, I focus on UX/UI design, UX writing and web accessibility, always keeping in mind the key value of any project: people. This new direction gives me the opportunity to merge my experience in communication and marketing with my growing technological knowledge, allowing me to create solutions that are user-centric and accessible to all.

My international background brings an enriching dimension to my vision and professional approach, enabling me to understand and adapt in an agile and effective way to the needs of a global audience.
